# sandydata. This is the initial baseline SysML v2 model of the Skyzer Mission Model based on the SysML v1 version that Keith provided per the email dated March 15, 2023. This is the first of a two step process to create the SysML v2 Skyzer Mission Model. The first step is to create a SysML v2 model that represents a transformation of the SysML v1 model to SysML v2. The second step is to refactor the transformed SysML v2 model to leverage the SysML v2 capabilities. This initial baseline reflects the first step only.  It is a partial model that contains over 50% of the content of the SysML v1 model (estimate only). For those areas that are not fully populated, a representative example is included to illustrate the corresponding SysML v2 representation. For example, a few shall statements for some of the requirements are included. It would be straightforward to add the text shall statements for the other requirements, but it may not be necessary to support the transition guidance. The same is true for requirements traceability relationships, control flows between actions, items flows between parts, and others. Some diagrams using the PlantUML integration with Jupyter are included in the Jupyter file. However, the diagrams are somewhat limited. It took approximately 20 hours to create the initial baseline manually, but eventually, the transformation will be automated.
